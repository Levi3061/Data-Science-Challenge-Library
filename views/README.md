# Data Science Challenge Library

A web-based platform designed for hosting and participating in data science competitions. Users can register, login, submit solutions to various challenges, and track their progress on leaderboards. The application integrates machine learning models to predict tags for questions and assess question quality, enabling a richer, data-driven challenge experience.

## Features

- **User Accounts:** Registration and login functionality to access restricted features.
- **Competitions & Leaderboards:** Browse ongoing challenges, submit solutions, and monitor standings.
- **Predictive Tools:** Utilize integrated ML models to:
  - Predict tags for given questions.
  - Assess the quality of questions.
- **File Uploads:** Upload PDFs and other documents related to challenges.
- **Responsive UI:** Cleanly structured EJS templates for pages like home, registration, login, competitions, and predictive analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Frontend:** EJS templates, CSS
- **Database:** (Specify if MongoDB, MySQL, etc. if applicable)
- **Machine Learning:** Python-based models (`.pkl` files), trained and tested separately
- **Version Control:** Git

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js & npm:** Ensure you have Node.js (>=12.x) and npm installed.
- **Python 3:** Required if you need to run or retrain the ML models.
- **Git:** Recommended for version control.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Levi3061/Data-Science-Challenge-Library.git
   cd Data-Science-Challenge-Library
   ```

2. **Install Node dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment (If Needed):**  
   If `secretkey.js` or other parts of the code expect environment variables, set them now:
   ```bash
   export SESSION_SECRET="your_secret_key"
   ```

### Running the App

```bash
npm start
```

By default, the server runs at `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your browser to access the home page.

### Using the Predictive Tools

- **Tag Prediction:**  
  Visit the `predict_tags.ejs` page in the browser. Input the question data and submit to receive predicted tags.

- **Question Quality:**  
  The `question_quality_predictor.py` script or the relevant page in the app can be used to rate the quality of a question. Input the question data and submit.

### Training and Testing Models

- **Train Models:**
  ```bash
  python3 train_model.py
  ```
  Adjust `train_model.py` for your data and parameters.

- **Test Models:**
  ```bash
  python3 test.py
  ```
  Run tests and verify that the models perform as expected.
